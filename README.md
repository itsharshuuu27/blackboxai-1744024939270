The project uses the following dependencies:

- Google Fonts for typography.

You can modify styles in the `styles.css` file or add additional scripts in `script.js` to enhance functionality further.

## Project Structure
Here’s how the project files are organized:

```
lunexa/

├── index.html         # Main HTML file for the website
├── styles.css         # Custom styles for the website
├── script.js          # JavaScript for interactivity
└── testimonials.html   # HTML file for testimonials (currently empty)
```

The primary styling and interactions are handled in the `styles.css` and `script.js` files, while `index.html` serves as the main entry point of the application, containing the structure and content of the site.
